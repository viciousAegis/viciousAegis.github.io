We introduce Cognac, a novel framework for corrective unlearning in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We show that existing state-of-the-art unlearning methods for GNNs are not effective in removing the influence of training data on model predictions. Cognac addresses this by leveraging a contrastive learning approach to learn a new representation of the graph that is less influenced by the data to be unlearned. Cognac beats retraining from scratch and matches the performance of an oracle method that has access to clean data, while being significantly more efficient.
