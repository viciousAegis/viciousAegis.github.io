We introduce Forge, a novel framework for generating explanations for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that leverages higher-order structures in graphs. Forge is designed to provide more comprehensive and interpretable explanations by considering relationships between groups of nodes rather than just pairwise interactions.
