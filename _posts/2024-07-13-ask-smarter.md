excerpt: "imagine this: you get 5 minutes with your tech idol, what all would you like to ask them? with time so limited, it hardly makes sense to ask general questions like “who is winning the ai race”. this information will (most prolly) not help you with anything. so how do you best utilise this limited time?"
